# Udacity Nanodegree Deep Learning Certification Course
## Program Outline
### Throughout this Nanodegree program I am learning:

How to implement Neural Networks using the deep learning library PyTorch.
Building Convolutional Netral Networks (CNN) for image recognition and classification.
Building Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) for sequence generation.
Generative adversarial networks for image generation.
Learn how to deploy models accessible from a website.
