## Project Overview


In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

# Predicting Bike-Sharing_Patterns
This project is the submission of Udacity Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns challenge. A Neural Network model is build to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. 

## The detaliled information about how to build and install code, and how to contribute is coming in future.
